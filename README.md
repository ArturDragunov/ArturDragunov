👋 Hi, I’m @ArturDragunov  
👀 I’m interested in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning. I enjoy exploring new technologies and continuously improving my skills in Python, SQL, R, and Excel. I have a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights, particularly in the Finance and IT sectors.
